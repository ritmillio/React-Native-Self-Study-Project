        What is HTML Canvas?
    The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.
    The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.
    Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.

    <canvas id="canvas" width="400" height="400"></canvas>
    <!--
        you can write direct javascript code into the html file 
    -->
    <script>
        var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
        var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
        ctx.moveTo(0, 0);
        ctx.lineTo(400,400);
        ctx.stroke();
        // this is how to draw a line to the canvas using js-- dig deeper later
    </script>
